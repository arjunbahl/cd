The reason that this relates to agency is that, ultimately, your awareness is what determines your beliefs and establishes the boundaries of what you perceive to be possible. This in turn directly impacts the daily decisions you make about what to do with yourself. If you read any biography of a prominent person, there will almost undoubtedly be a mention of an event or an instance that completely changed how they approached their lives. Sometimes, it’s a brush with mortality, but other times, it’s something as simple as realizing that maybe the rules they had always assumed to be facts weren’t actually set in stone. We all have these pivots of awareness that shift our perspective about what is real and what is important and what is worth doing. We can’t intellectualize them beforehand because they require first-hand exposure through experience. They expand agency by redefining possibility.","The best advice on choosing a career, Buffett said, was to find something you loved. After that, the money would seem unimportant. He said he drank the same sodas as us and ate the same fast food, though he got a discount at Dairy Queen because he owned it. He slept on the same kind of mattress, which meant for at least seven hours in the day we were no less comfortable than he. The only real difference, he said, was that “I fly differently.”The evening before my first interview, the California firm held a get-to-know-you dinner at an Alsatian restaurant off Harvard Square. Thirty of us crowded into a basement room, tricked out like a German Stube . You could spot the executives by their gleaming white shirts and the fact that they were throwing back red wine while the rest of us sipped delicately at soda water. I was seated opposite a fund manager who had bristling silver hair and a burning red shaving rash all over the lower half of his skeletal face. He was a caricature of dissatisfaction. His breath, which worsened with every gulp of Merlot and slice of roast duck, was paint stripper and his humor barbed. He told us he was a technology consultant for years before achieving his dream of stock-picking for a living. “I lived and breathed stocks,” he said, staring at me goggleeyed. “That’s the only way to do this. I read every book I could. I learned about every company I could. I didn’t go to business school. There were no short-cuts for me. I ran my own portfolio while I was working and kept on applying for these jobs until finally I got this one.” He asked us how many of the cases we read in preparation for class. All of them, I told him. Two Indian men at the table said they read only one in three or one in five at the most. I could not tell if they were joking, but they said that they had better things to do with their time at HBS than read sloppy marketing and LEAD cases. For example, they liked to play poker five nights a week. The fund manager seemed to like this. With dessert came a shuffling of places and another of the executives came and sat at our table. He and his colleague began to trade war stories while sloshing back more wine. “Did you see Howie just played Pebble Beach? Howie runs our media fund. He’s the guy who bumped off the CEO of AOL. Brilliant guy. Legend. Beats the market every year. Never misses. Twenty years straight. Rupert Murdoch calls him for advice. I mean, the guy’s a legend. He bought Viacom at ten!” Away from home with nothing to do but interview students, they were wallowing in their fully expensed trip, ordering more wine, more chocolate ganache with raspberry sauce, swapping more war stories. “So Bill was reading the financial statements—Bill’s our head retail analyst, guys—and he noticed that inventory had just gone through the roof and same-store sales were lagging. They were just piling up crap in the stores and no one was buying, but it was still seen as this hot company, right? So he started unloading the thing. No one else had seen it and he got out before the stock tanked thirty percent. Unbelievable.”","Having established the goal of sustainable competitive advantage, the strategist’s next task is to develop and integrate a consistent set of mutually reinforcing activities. The aim is not to have the greatest marketing department in the world but, rather, the best marketing department for your company.","What Is Strategy?,” that laid out the five forces he believed determined a company’s ability to capture value. They are: barriers to entry, supplier power, customer power, substitutes, and rivalry.  The first thing to understand about strategy, we learned, is that it is not operational efficiency. You could run the best laundry in the world, but if what you were doing was quite simple and thousands of others could do it, you were not going to make any money. You lacked, as Felix liked to say, “a great strategy.” A beautifully run restaurant with the greatest chef in the world could be an economic disaster, while owning a few grubby fast-food franchises could make you a millionaire. Being very good at doing something was absolutely no guarantee of financial success. I recalled Steenburgh in marketing telling us, “A good product alone won’t get you there.” So the first challenge for the strategist was picking the right thing to do. Felix showed us a graph of the distribution of returns on equity of major American companies over the past twenty years. Most returned between 10 and 15 percent a year. But a few had returns on equity over 20 percent. What were they doing that enabled them to do this? The most profitable companies year after year tended to be in a few sectors: pharmaceuticals, high-technology, financial services, discount department stores, and oil. The worst major industry to be in was airlines.","One of the most remarkable companies we studied was called Li and Fung, which was founded in 1906 in Canton as a trading company, helping English and American merchants get access to Chinese factories. Based in Hong Kong, it now managed the supply chains for many of the world’s largest retailers and manufacturers. In 1976, Victor Fung, the grandson of the founder and a professor at HBS, returned to Hong Kong to take over the firm. He and his younger brother, William, a Harvard MBA, decided to expand the scope of the company’s operations. Instead of being an intermediary between foreign companies and Hong Kong suppliers, Li and Fung built relationships throughout Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, and eventually deeper into China. It went from simply fulfilling customer requests to developing unique production programs that allowed manufacturers to create products of a quality and cost they never thought possible. If you wanted shirts made in Asia, Li and Fung would know separate places for cotton, buttons, and stitching and be able to move the unfinished product from one place to another and still deliver it cheaper than if you had picked a single factory. They called what they did “dispersed manufacturing,” and their staff, “little John Waynes,” because they spent their days “standing in the middle of the wagon train, shooting at all the bad guys.”","In daily life have Baniya Mindset, not only for financial requirements but for all other aspects as well, for isntance for getting higher productivity and effectiveness. Getting more output from same amount of time.","Accomplishing more in limited time, grabbing more oppurtunities in same scenario and time-frame.","For instance if you find 30-40 mins of free time in evening(before heading out to play) use that as well to get output(relevant- as per priorities), maybe for completing course at 2x speed, so that 30 mins gets transformed into an hour. Or when going to college instead of just “attending” classes get more output by convincing teachers for extra attendance or making good connections with them or peers as well, or any other relevant activity. Use all the available time in the most effecient manner. Make time available, and then use it in the most optimum manner. Use Baniya Management, getting more done without sacrificing anything or incurring any cost.","“Once a young man asked Socrates the secret to success. Socrates asked the young man to meet him at the riverside the next morning. They met. Socrates asked the young man to walk with him into the water and he did. Suddenly Socrates ducked the kid underwater and held him there till the kid started turning blue. Then, Socrates pulled him out. The first thing the kid did was to take a deep breath. Socrates asked him, ‘Son, when you were under water what did you want the most?’ The young man said, ‘Air.’ Socrates said, ‘Son, there is no secret to success. When you want success, as badly as you wanted air when you were in the water you will have it. Nobody will be able to stop you that day.’ This is called a burning desire. This is the difference between preferences and convictions in life; preferences are negotiable, convictions are not; and under pressure, preferences always become weak whereas convictions become stronger.”","‘Do you know the difference between winners and losers?’ Then he said something very profound, ‘Winners form the habit of doing things that losers don’t like to do. What are the things losers don’t like to do? Well, they are the same things winners don’t like to do either, but they do them anyway.’ Then he gave me an example. He said, ‘Losers don’t like to work hard. Winners don’t like to work hard either, but they work hard anyway. Losers don’t like to get up in the morning. Winners don’t like to get up in the morning either, but they get up anyway.’”(Chapter:4 Attitude Determines Success)“Discipline is doing what ought to be done, when it ought to be done, whether we like it or not. Life is like push and pull. Sometimes, we push ourselves and sometimes we have to pull ourselves, just like an automobile needs both the accelerator and the brake, one without the other will cause damage. Similarly an army without discipline is guaranteed to fail. Discipline is really the spirit that strengthens an army and gives courage and strength even to a small group to face big challenges.”","Using the Rule is simple. Whenever you feel an instinct fire up to act on a goal or a commitment, or the moment you feel that yourself hesitate on doing something and you know you should do, use the Rule. Physical movement is the most important part of my Rule, too, because when you move your physiology changes and your mind follows.","ranbir kapoor rockstar","boring chup rehne wale","Greed- bhookh- like during school- skating/TT/Acads/Spanish/Computing/Music/Tech","Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice","Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
